# README for Greenbriar Treatment Center Redirect Site

## Site Design

The site page is just a flat index file with an images folder containing the Better Together logo.  The site uses W3 Schools hosted CSS for layout.  

The primary purpose to this site is to create a redirect from greenbriar.net to gatewayrehab.org.  This is accomplished with a Meta Refresh tag in the header.

## Site Hosting

The site is hosted through GitHub Pages.  It is hosted on the Gateway Rehab organization and uses the greenbriar.net custom domain.

DNS is hosted through Network Solutions.  DNS records include 'A' records for each of the GitHub servers and a 'CNAME' record for www.greenbriar.net.
