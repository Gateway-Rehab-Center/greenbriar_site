# README for Greenbriar Treatment Center Redirect Site

## Site Design

The site page is just a flat index file with an images folder containing the Better Together logo.  The site uses W3 Schools hosted CSS for layout.  

The primary purpose to this site is to create a redirect from greenbriar.net to gatewayrehab.org.  This is accomplished with a Meta Refresh tag in the header.
